Task 5 Research Analysis
Research Question: What are the amount of turns in each game for White Winners, Black
Winners. We also wanted to find out the amount of turns overall for each games. In the future
we are looking to find an average number of turns for a winning game. This can be shown in the
Scatterplot shown below.
It seems that the threshold of turns durastically increases in games that end as a draw, as
oppopsed to a white winner or a a black winner.
It also seems that the difference between white and black winning is quite small. I would like to
research the exact difference in the future.
In our analyses, we looked into the amount of turns each game, and formulated a histogram
from the results which can be shown below. The majority of the games consisted of around 40 -
8 terms, with a steep drop off after that. In the future, I would like to investigate how many
games ended in a draw after around 150 turns.
*Research Question: What is the most common victory status? and Why?*
In our analysis, first we wanted to understand what is the most common victory status.
Eventually, we would like to determine why that certain status&#39; happen more than others, and
what could lead to a specific one. Shown in the chat below is a countplot of the 3 victory status&#39;
from our dataset:
1. Mate
2. Resign
3. Draw
Shown the above countplot, resign seems to be the most common victory status. It happens in
almost double the amount of games that mate does. We are not sure why this is. Later in our
analyses, we are going to see all the different types of openings to a match. This could be a
possible effect of a victory status.
