# Group 1038 - Cool Data Science Chess Project

Let's see if we can learn something cool about chess!!!!! :D

## Tableau Dashboard

Have a gander at our [tableau dashboard](https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com/#/site/data301/workbooks/346956/views) and our investigation into online chess trends.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## **Describe your topic/interest**

Chess - a nearly 1500 year old game - has infamous ties to computer science based on it's complexity. The advent of new and faster technology has revolutionized the way players can play, practice, and study the game. In recent decades, chess engines such as [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) and [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) have outmatched humans. Online platforms such as [Chess.com](https://chess.com) and [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) facilitate play between users on a global scale and have developed large databases of information and data based on these games. Studying the gameplay data may provide users with better insights on how to improve their games through statistical analysis on successful opening strategies. Through this project, correlation between different opening strategies and the outcome of the match may be investigated.


## **Describe your dataset**
The dataset we chose was collected in 2017 and contains information about 20,000 online chess games played on the online platform Lichess.org. The data was collected through a program named LichessAPI, which collects any users game history. The purpose of the data set is for further analysis into which factors affect a chess match. 

_The dataset includes:_
- User ratings
- Which user was black and which was white 
- The moves played along with the number of moves
- Whether the game was rated or not
- How the game ended
- Who the winner was
- Start time and end time
- The time increment used
- The name the of opening
- The number of moves required for the opening

The dataset was prepared by kaggle user [MitchellJ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek) and is part of the creative commons CC0.
